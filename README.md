Title of the Project -  SMART ATTENDANCE SYSTEM 

PROJECT OVERVIEW —
The Smart Attendance System is a simple but practical Python application designed to mark and manage student attendance digitally. It replaces traditional manual entry and offers a faster, more accurate, and organized method to maintain attendance records.

The project is built using basic Python concepts and three essential modules:

Modules Used-

1. datetime – automatically captures the current date and time when a student marks attendance.


2. csv – stores attendance data in a structured CSV file for easy retrieval and analysis.


3. os – checks if the attendance file exists and creates one if necessary.

Purpose of the Project-

The main aim of this project is to automate the attendance process by:

-Reducing manual paperwork

-Minimizing errors in attendance entry

-Allowing students to mark attendance easily

-Maintaining records in a neat and exportable format

How the System Works-

1. File Initialization:
When the program starts, it checks if attendance.csv exists; if not, it creates one with column headers.


2. Mark Attendance:
Students enter their Roll Number and Name, and the system records:

Roll Number

Name

Current Date

Current Time



3. View Attendance:
All attendance records can be viewed anytime directly in the console.


4. Data Storage:
Attendance entries are stored permanently in a CSV file, which can be opened in Excel or Google Sheets.

Conclusion-

The Smart Attendance System is a practical introductory Python project that uses foundational programming concepts to solve a daily-life problem. 

Core Features-

-Fully menu-driven program

-Automatic timestamping (date and time)

-Permanent data storage in CSV

-Easy to read and manage records

-Works on any system with Python installed 

Technologies/Tools Used-

-Python Programming Language 
-Python Standard Library Modules 
 datetime Module 
 csv Module 
 os Module 
-CSV File 
-Code Editor (VSCode)

Steps to install & run the project-

1)Install Python
2)Create a new folder anywhere on your computer . Inside the folder , create a python file . Copy Paste the full source code into this file.
3) Using VSCode , click file option then open folder and select project folder . Open your file and run it. 

Instructions for testing-

1. Run the program using python to open the main menu. 


2. Confirm that the file attendance.csv is created automatically if it does not exist.


3. Select Option 1: Mark Attendance from the menu.


4. Enter a valid roll number and name to record attendance.


5. Check that the program displays a success message with correct date and time.


6. Open attendance.csv and verify that the new entry was added correctly.


7. Repeat attendance marking for multiple students to ensure consistent saving.


8. Select Option 2: View Attendance and confirm that all saved entries are displayed.


9. Close and rerun the program, then view attendance again to ensure data persistence.


10. Select Option 3: Exit to confirm the program closes without errors.
